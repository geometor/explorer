# 7. Robust Element Deletion and Debugging

-   **Objective:** Safely handle element deletion without breaking the model and provide better debugging tools.
-   **Challenges:** Deleting an element that other elements depend on can lead to an invalid model state.
-   **Plan:**
    -   **Dependency Graph:** Implement a dependency graph in the backend to track relationships between elements. Before deleting an element, analyze the graph to determine the impact. This will allow for either preventing the deletion or performing a cascading delete of all dependent elements.
    -   **Testing:** Develop a comprehensive test suite specifically for element deletion scenarios, covering various dependency situations to ensure model integrity.
