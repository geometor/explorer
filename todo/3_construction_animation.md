# 3. Construction Animation

-   **Objective:** Animate the step-by-step creation of the geometric construction.
-   **Strategy:**
    -   **Backend:** The construction data will need to be ordered chronologically. The backend should provide the elements in the order they were created.
    -   **Frontend:** Implement a "Play" button and a slider to control the animation.
    -   **Controls:** Implement play, pause, start, end, and step controls, with keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys), to provide granular control over the animation timeline.
