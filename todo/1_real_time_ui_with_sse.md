# 1. Real-Time UI with Server-Sent Events (SSE)

-   **Objective:** Decouple the frontend from blocking backend processes to create a fully responsive, real-time user experience.
-   **Strategy:** Implement a Server-Sent Events (SSE) architecture to push incremental updates from the server to the UI.
-   **Plan:** See the detailed implementation plan in `SSE_INTEGRATION.md`.
