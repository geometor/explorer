# GEOMETOR Explorer: Development Roadmap

### 1. Real-Time UI with Server-Sent Events (SSE)

-   **Objective:** Decouple the frontend from blocking backend processes to create a fully responsive, real-time user experience.
-   **Strategy:** Implement a Server-Sent Events (SSE) architecture to push incremental updates from the server to the UI.
-   **Plan:** See the detailed implementation plan in `SSE_INTEGRATION.md`.

### 2. Enhanced File Handling

-   **Objective:** Create a more professional and seamless file handling experience with persistent filenames and non-disruptive status updates.
-   **Plan:** See the detailed implementation plan in `FILE_HANDLING_IMPROVEMENTS.md`.

### 3. "Divine" Golden Section Analysis (Initial Integration Complete)

-   **Objective:** Integrate real-time analysis of golden sections as new points are added to the construction.
-   **Current State:** The backend now runs a full analysis on the model each time a new element is added.
-   **Next Steps:**
    -   **Backend:** Transition from a full analysis on every change to a more efficient, event-driven approach. Use the `point_added` event from the `geometor.model` to trigger a targeted analysis of only the new point and its related elements.
    -   **Frontend:** After a new point is created, the frontend will receive the updated analysis. The results will be displayed in a dedicated "Analysis" or "Divine" panel in the UI.

### 3. Construction Animation

-   **Objective:** Animate the step-by-step creation of the geometric construction.
-   **Strategy:**
    -   **Backend:** The construction data will need to be ordered chronologically. The backend should provide the elements in the order they were created.
    -   **Frontend:** Implement a "Play" button and a slider to control the animation. Use JavaScript to incrementally add and animate the SVG elements.

### 4. UI/UX Overhaul for Complex Models

-   **Objective:** Redesign the user interface to efficiently display complex models, provide real-time process feedback, and improve data interaction.
-   **Plan:** See the detailed implementation plan in `UI_UX_IMPROVEMENTS.md`.
