# Completed: Guide Elements

-   **Objective:** Give users more control over the appearance and behavior of elements in the construction.
-   **Features:**
    -   **Guide Elements (Implemented):** Introduce a "guide" property for lines and circles. Guide elements are visually distinct (orange, dashed style) and are excluded from intersection checks, preventing them from creating new points. This is useful for construction lines that are not part of the a final figure.
