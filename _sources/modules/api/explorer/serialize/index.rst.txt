.. py:function:: to_browser_dict(model)

   Serializes the model to a dictionary format suitable for a browser-based
   application, preserving the order of creation.

   This method creates a dictionary containing the model's name and a single
   list of 'elements'. Each item in the list represents a geometric element
   in the order it was added to the model. This format is easy for a web
   client to parse and render sequentially.

   Each element dictionary includes:
   - A 'type' field (e.g., 'point', 'line').
   - Data relevant to the element type, including floating-point values for
     rendering and LaTeX expressions for display.
