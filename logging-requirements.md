FEATURE: improve the user feedback with accurate - easy to read logging

this will affect model, divine and explorer - we should create matching branches in each - each has direct print statements during operation - we will want to handle this consistently with the objective to create reports that may be viewed in console, web ui, or saved to file.

there are two places we want to see the log - first (and only current) is the output of Flask app - second, we want a new log panel for the user to see activity with incremental updates from the server.

so the first step is to clean up our print statements - make sure the order makes sense = and creates a nice status for the user

below is a capture from the Flask app for a typical model build. the order is is out of whack - for instance the line `- A B - = y` is printed by model before the /api/construct/line call in explorer app.

I like the event model we are using with explorer - and it may be the way to track activities to log.

Getting the sequencing and formatting done at the server level first will be critical before moving on to incremental updates sent to the ui.

let's go in the following order:

- understand all the print statements in the three projects - what and when are they printing.
- consider the strategy and flow of the information for the user.
- the Log at the server can be much more technical - but there should be far less repetitive words printed

I am thinking about something simple like this (of course we can use highlighting and bolding to improve readability of data elements - like always bolding the name and trying to map to our styles for element colors:
